Hello! We are looking to implement temperature and humidity in a "Nagios" 
Environment for our bachelors project, can you give us some prices and 
info for equipment you would recommend?

We have looked at this one: HWg-STE: Ethernet thermometer,
With this we also need probes.
Can you ship to Norway?

Regards
