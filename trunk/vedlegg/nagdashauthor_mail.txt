Hi!

We're doing a bachelor thesis where we implement Icinga for the local
county. We are currently looking at solutions for how to implement
dashboard functionality to give a quick overview to help desk workers.
We looked at Nagdash and it seems like a good starting point for what we
want to do, so we were wondering what license, if any, it is published
under.

Sincerely,
Ã˜yvind Sigerstad
