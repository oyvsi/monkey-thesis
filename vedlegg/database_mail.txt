Hello from Norway!

We are a bachelor group from Norway doing our project on Icinga, by now we
have about 200 hosts and 600 service checks, and using your MySQL, MSSQL,
and your Oracle plugins for a couple of database servers.

Now my question is, we have some different Oracle servers, they are
running a different number of Oracle instances, Should we monitor every
instance? Which means checks like cache hit and connection time should be
checked on every "Instance" Not only each server?

In that case, is there a way to check all instances for one server? Don't
really want to script alot of services, or use check multi.
