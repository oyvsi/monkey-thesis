Emne:Question about check_xenapi.pl plugin for Nagios

Hello

I have started using the check_xenapi.pl plugin and I am wondering about
the results it is returning. From what I have understood it uses the data
with the latest timestamp from this code block:

sub get_latest_perfdata {
    my ($obj, $timestamp) =3D @_;
    my $rrd =3D $obj->get_rrd_update($timestamp);
    my $perf =3D {};
    my $time =3D 0;
    # get newest perf data
    foreach my $row (@{$rrd}) {
        if ($time < $row->{timestamp}) {
            $time =3D $row->{timestamp};
            $perf =3D $row->{data};
        }
    }
    return $perf;


The plugin also per default asks the RRD-database for data in the following
interval (quoted from the documentation on RRDs on XenServer):

*Every 5 seconds for the duration of 10 minutes

And for this interval it says the following:

*The sampling that takes place every 5 seconds records actual data points

So my question is really if this is intended behavior, because I have not
found any options to specify which interval I want data from, or if this
should be averaged. The returned results will be actual datapoints, which
can hard to set tresholds on since a spike can happen in that 5 second
interval.

I might be totally off here, and misunderstood the code / or use of the
plugin.


Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
Bjoern-Erik
